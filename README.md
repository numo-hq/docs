### What is Numoen?

Numoen is a fully decentralized and oracle-free derivatives exchange that can support an options market on any token.&#x20;

All exchange is facilitated by the Power Market Maker Protocol (PMMP) for which Numoen is an application on. As a **fully autonomous protocol**, PMMP has no admin functions, zero external dependencies, and all smart contracts are non-upgradable and hosted on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) without any trusted intermediaries.&#x20;
