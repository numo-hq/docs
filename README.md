### What is Numoen?

Numoen is a fully decentralized and oracle-free derivatives exchange that can support an options market on any token.&#x20;

All exchange is facilitated by the Power Market Maker Protocol (PMMP) for which Numoen is an application on. As a **fully autonomous protocol**, there are no admin functions and zero external dependencies and all non-upgradable smart contracts are hosted on the Ethereum Virtual Machine  without any trusted intermediaries.&#x20;
