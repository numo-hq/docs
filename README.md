## What is the PowerMaker?

PowerMaker is an automated market maker for power perpetuals. A power perptual is an index that tracks price of a token to a power. For PowerMaker I, this is quadratic or 2. By trading a power perpetual, a trader can get a continuously releveraging position known as convexity. &#x20;



As a **fully autonomous protocol**, PowerMaker has no admin functions, zero external dependencies, and all smart contracts are non-upgradable and hosted on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) without any trusted intermediaries.&#x20;

## Where can I access the PowerMaker protocol?

PowerMaker is source available and hosted on Arbitrum. Therefore any public functions are exposed and can be called by an external program. For the most user-friendly experience, PowerMaker can accessed on the web application numotrade.com.
