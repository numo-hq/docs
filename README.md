### What is Numoen?

Numoen, an application for interacting with the Power Market Maker Protocol (PMMP), allows any user to hedge their Uniswap V3 LP position in three simple clicks.&#x20;



PMMP is a suite of non-upgradable smart contracts that function without any trusted intermediaries. The protocol is designed for taking two underlying assets and creating a derivative asset with constant leverage, referred to as "Power Tokens". As a **fully autonomous protocol**, there are no admin functions and zero external dependencies.
