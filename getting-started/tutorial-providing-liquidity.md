3. Provide liquidity to the highest APR pool. There are two separate pools as the pool on the right is for going long and the left is for going short.

TIP: Look at the "implied vol." statistic to see if the pool is profitable for an LP. If the realized volatility is less than the implied which is the expected volatility then you would want to LP.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
