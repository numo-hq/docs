# Disclaimer

Numoen Core is a protocol for the decentralized exchange and automated liquidity provisioning of options directly on the blockchain. The protocol has no governable parameters, no special privileges, and is non-custodial. Please understand that while the code has been audited it does **not guarantee the safety of your funds**. In fact, interacting with the protocol can come with substantial risks. Be aware of these risks before interacting with PMMP. A governance token should never be expected.
