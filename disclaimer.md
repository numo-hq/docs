# Disclaimer

**PowerMaker is a protocol** for the automated liquidity provisioning of power perpetuals directly on the blockchain. The protocol has no governable parameters, no special privileges, and is non-custodial. Please understand that while the code has been audited by Code4rena it does **not guarantee the safety of your funds**. In fact, interacting with the protocol can come with substantial risks. Be aware of these risks before interacting with PowerMaker. A governance token should never be expected.

Numoen.com is not a protocol but an application that interacts with PowerMaker, a set of smart contracts that are hosted on Arbitrum. &#x20;
