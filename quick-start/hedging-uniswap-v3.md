# Hedging Uniswap V3

Numoen has created first ever, easy to use product for hedging Uniswap LP loss called **Numoen Nest**. You can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/numoen/death-to-impermanent-loss-introducing-numoen-nest-1c1a2b3fba84).

As mentioned in the article, the ability to hedge every single Uniswap LP comes from the innovation of the Power Market Maker Protocol (PMMP). This is a fully decentralized AMM for minting Power Tokens which are option-like derivatives on any token that have **Positive Gamma**.

## Hedging Process <a href="#id-41d5" id="id-41d5"></a>

Hedging the impermanent loss of a Uniswap LP simply entails canceling out the negative gamma of a LP share with the positive gamma of a Power Token.

For the example above we take a _ETH/USDC LP_ position with the following parameters:

```
ETH Price: $1825.53

USDC Price:$1

Lower Bound: $1600

Upper Bound: $2000
```

So to hedge the following Uniswap LP position we:

1. **Calculate the price of a Power Token**

Becuase every Power Token (PT) is a **quadratic contract,** we know that it will square the price of an underlying asset, “squared leverage.” In fact, we also know that the **gamma will always be a constant 2** (this useful for the next step).

> The price of a PT = (Price of the underlying asset)².
>
> If ETH = $1825.53, then the price of a PT = (1825.53)² = 3332559.78

**2. Calculate the value of a Uniswap LP**

With Uniswap V3, the valuing a LP share get a bit more tricky as there is a lower bound and upper bound which refer to the prices between which the liquidity is concentrated on the AMM.

The value of a Uniswap LP is defined as:

**3. Calculate the gamma of Uniswap LP**

Assuming that the price of the underlying asset is with in the lower and upper bound 0, then the gamma will be:

If the price of ETH = $1825.53, then the gamma of the Uniswap LP is:

**4. Calculate the number of Power Tokens.**

Using the positive gamma value and price of a Power Token we find the number of Power Tokens needed to hedge a Uniswap LP position.

Which is the gamma of Uniswap over the negative gamma of a Power Token. Therefore the number of PT needed is:

## **Total Returns** <a href="#id-692d" id="id-692d"></a>

After analyzing the on-chain data for the 7 days `block.timestamp` we can chart the value of the hedged portfolio versus a non-hedge portfolio or “LP Value.” We show that the **hedge portfolio \[ETH/USDC LP] consistently outperforms across wide and tight bounds**.
