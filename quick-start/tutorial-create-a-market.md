2. Select a token to go long and token to short.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: If you are going long, think of the "short" token as the denominating token. So if you are long ETH and want the price in USDC, then go long ETH and short USDC.
{% endhint %}

3. Select a bound and make sure it is above the current price!
