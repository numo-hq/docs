# Capped Power Invariant

The capped power-2 invariant is the trading invariant vital to PowerMaker. It was introduced in a research paper called [_Replicating Monotonic Payoffs Without Oracles._](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13740)

$$
\varphi(R_{1}, R_{2}) = R_{1}-\left(p_{1}-\frac{1}{2}R_{2}\right)^{2}
$$
