# Protocol Participants

PMMP primarily connects three types of users: liquidity providers, traders, and arbitrageurs.&#x20;

In total interactions between these three classes create a new market structure and resulting financial product that was previously unavailable.

## Liquidity Providers

Liquidity providers rent out their liquidity to PMMP in exchange for continuous funding payments from those borrowing their liquidity.&#x20;

## Traders

Traders mint Power Tokens for two main reasons:

* Speculate on price movements with more expressiveness than simply buying or selling spot.
* Hedge against price movements that would be detrimental to existing positions they hold elsewhere.

## Arbitrageurs

Arbitrageurs seek profits by comparing prices across different platforms to find an edge. These participants equalize prices across all markets and keep things fair.
