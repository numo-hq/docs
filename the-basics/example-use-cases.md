## Earn

If you think prices are going to stay the same, provide liquidity to PMMP via the Numoen application to earn interest on your deposits. Users earn directly from the funding paid by Power Token holders. &#x20;

## Hedge

Reduce your volatility exposure via gamma hedging. On-chain assets are exposed to not just directional price risk, but also volatility. An example of this are Uniswap LP shares which act similar as an exotic option instrument. To hedge what is called "impermanent loss," traders can use Power Tokens which have a non-linear payoff that is perfect for hedging exotic instruments such as Uniswap LP shares.
